# Pattern-
This C++ program, crafted during my first semester at COMSATS University Islamabad, Abbottabad Campus, generates a symmetric diamond pattern of 'x' characters in an n x n grid, where n is a user-provided positive integer. It reflects my early exploration of nested loops, user input handling, and console-based pattern generation.
